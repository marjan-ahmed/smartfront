# Quickstart Guide: AI-Powered Frontend Builder

## Overview
The AI-Powered Frontend Builder is a multi-agent system that automatically generates semantic HTML, responsive CSS, and accessible JavaScript based on natural language descriptions. The system follows the SmartFront constitution principles of agent specialization, frontend-first design, and accessibility-first development.

## Prerequisites
- Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge)
- Basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Access to the AI frontend builder system

## Getting Started

### 1. Generate Your First Page
To generate a basic web page:

1. Navigate to the frontend builder interface
2. Provide a description of your desired page (e.g., "A landing page with a header, hero section, and features")
3. Click "Generate" to create the page

The system will generate:
- Semantic HTML with proper structure and accessibility attributes
- Responsive CSS that works across mobile, tablet, and desktop
- Accessible JavaScript with progressive enhancement

### 2. Component-Based Development
To use reusable components:

1. Browse the component library for available UI elements
2. Select components that match your design needs
3. Add them to your page description
4. The system will integrate them with proper styling and behavior

### 3. Quality Assurance
After generation, the system automatically runs quality checks:

1. Accessibility validation (WCAG 2.1 AA compliance)
2. Responsive design testing
3. Performance optimization checks
4. Semantic HTML validation

Review the validation results and recommendations to refine your page.

## Multi-Agent Workflow

The system uses specialized agents for different aspects:

- **HTML Agent**: Generates semantic, accessible HTML structure
- **CSS Agent**: Creates responsive, performant styling
- **JS Agent**: Adds interactive behavior with progressive enhancement
- **QA Agent**: Validates accessibility, performance, and best practices

## Example Usage

### Simple Page Generation
```
Input: "Create a contact page with a form, company information, and map"
Output: Complete HTML page with:
- Semantic form with proper labels and validation
- Responsive layout for all screen sizes
- Accessible form controls and navigation
- Progressive enhancement for JavaScript features
```

### Component Integration
```
Input: "Build a dashboard with navigation sidebar, header, and data cards"
Output: Page with:
- Reusable navigation component
- Responsive header with user controls
- Data cards with consistent styling
- Proper accessibility attributes
```

## Validation and Testing

After generation, validate your page:

1. Check the accessibility score (aim for 95+)
2. Test responsiveness on different screen sizes
3. Verify keyboard navigation works properly
4. Confirm JavaScript features work with and without JavaScript enabled

## Best Practices

1. **Be Specific**: Provide clear, detailed descriptions for better results
2. **Iterate**: Start with basic descriptions and refine based on output
3. **Validate**: Always review the automatic validation results
4. **Test**: Manually test generated pages in browsers

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
- **Vague descriptions**: Provide more specific details for better results
- **Complex layouts**: Break down into simpler components first
- **Accessibility warnings**: Review and implement the suggested fixes

## Next Steps

1. Explore the component library for more complex UI patterns
2. Learn about advanced features like custom component creation
3. Integrate with your existing development workflow
4. Review the full documentation for advanced customization options
